            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I was born in the state of Telangana in Hyderabad, India. I have lived in India more than half of my life. I was 15 years old when I moved to the United States. I moved to the Unites States in September 2010. There were a lot of things that were absolutely different from those in India. Some of the differences that I saw were in the culture, education, and communication.

            <h2>Educational Differences</h2>
            <p>
                In India, I went to an all-girls school from kindergarten to 10th grade. I moved to the United States after completing my 10th grade. One week after coming to the U.S, my grandfather took me to the school to get me registered. I was really very excited to join the school and nervous at the same time because it was a co-ed school. The first thing I noticed was I had to change classrooms to go to each class period. Whereas, in India the teachers used to come to the classroom to teach us all day. The first hour was English and we were going to write an essay. In India, students had book specifically for essays and here I had to use a laptop to write an essay. This was something that I had to learn to do. I always had a habit of writing using pen and paper and switching to typing was very difficult. The way to assessments was also very different. Also, here in the U.S everything was more hands on and practical. In India students were only taught about the experiments and had asked to remember all of it, but here in the U.S we actually get to perform the experiments.

            <h3>Communication Differences</h3>
            <p>
                People in India are very loud. In India, saying an outright 'no' to someone is considered offensive, instead they say something that the person wants to hear. Any kind of feedback is done privately because they tend to think that their respect is lost. However, here in the U.S. is completely different. People are more calm. Communication is more direct and any feedback is direct and critical.
