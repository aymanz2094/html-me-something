            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I was born in the state of Telangana in Hyderabad, India. I have lived in India more than half of my life. I was 15 years old when I moved to the United States. There were a lot of things that were absolutely different from those in India. Some of the differences that I saw were in the culture, education, and communication.I'll go over a few of the differences that I have noticed.
            </p>
            <h2>Cultural Differences</h2>
            <p>
                There is huge difference between the cultures here in America and India. In India, family ties are extremely close-knit. Young people tend to stay in the family home until they marry. Arranged marriages are normal and marrying someone from a different caste is frowned upon, eventhough discrimination because of someones caste is illegal India. Indians are brought up to be dependent on the family, rather than to think independently.</p>
            <p>
                Whereas in the USA families tend to be more dispersed. Young people will leave home when they go to universiity and be financilly independent when they start work. The culture in the US is almost opposite; individuals are expected to fend for themselves and face the consequences of their actions. 
            </p>
            <h2>Educational Differences</h2>
            <p>
                In India, I went to an all-girls school from kindergarten to 10th grade. I moved to the United States after completing my 10th grade. One week after coming to the U.S, my grandfather took me to the school to get me registered. I was really very excited to join the school and nervous at the same time because it was a co-ed school. The first thing I noticed was I had to change classrooms to go to each class period. Whereas, in India the teachers used to come to the classroom to teach us all day. The first hour was English and we were going to write an essay. In India, students had book specifically for essays and here I had to use a laptop to write an essay. This was something that I had to learn to do. I always had a habit of writing using pen and paper and switching to typing was very difficult. The way to assess students was also very different. Also, here in the U.S everything was more hands on and practical. In India students were only taught about the experiments and were asked to remember all of it, but here in the U.S we actually get to perform the experiments. I really like the way of teaching here in the United States, which is why I decided to get my Bachelors degree in Elementary Education.
            </p>
            <h2>Communication Differences</h2>
            <p>
                People in India are very loud. In India, saying an outright 'no' to someone is considered offensive, instead they say something that the person wants to hear. Any kind of feedback is done privately because they tend to think that their respect is lost. However, here in the U.S. is completely different. People are more calm. Communication is more direct and any feedback is direct and critical.
